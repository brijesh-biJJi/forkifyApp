# forkifyApp

Forkify Application is all about searching for Recipe or Ingredients & displaying them on User Interface.

## User Stories

1. As a User, I want to **_search for recipes_**, so that I can find new ideas for meals.
2. As a User, I want to be able to **_update the number of servings_**, so that I can cook a meal for different number of people.
3. As a User, I want to **_bookmark recipes_**, so that I can review them later.
4. As a User, I want to be able to **_create my own recipes_**, so that I have them all organized in the same app.
5. As a User, I want to be able to **_see my bookmarks & own recipes when I have the app & come back later_**, so that I can close the app safely after cooking.
